I've been working on this project where I used Spring Boot and Java to create a web application. 
I also used PostgreSQL as my database. I created a simple HTML file that is divided into two parts. 
To make it easier to handle, I created two controllers: one for the first part called "SearchController" and another 
for the second part called "SearchForKeywordsController."
To access my application, I used the URL "http://localhost:8080/". 
Both parts of the task are separate, I treated them as separate entities without any connection between them.
